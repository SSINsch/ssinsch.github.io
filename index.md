> I served as a captain in the ROK Army for seven years, working in information security with AI.  
> I spent the first five years as a security researcher at the Agency for Defense Development (ADD), where I researched the application of deep learning in the field of cybersecurity.
> The next two years were spent at ROK Cyber Operations Command, where I contributed to military security by researching and analyzing operational applications which I was skilled at.  
> I earned a Master's degree in Information Security at Korea University under the supervision of [Seong-Jun Oh](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=ebq6ex0AAAAJ).
> My master's thesis focused on `Learning with noisy labels` through data sampling.

## CVE
- CVE-2020-24240 (ADD, Seoul National University)
    >GNU Bison before 3.7.1 has a use-after-free in _obstack_free in lib/obstack.c (called from gram_lex) when a '\0' byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself,not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.
- CVE-2020-24241 (ADD, Seoul National University)
    >In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.15rc10, there is heap use-after-free in saa_wbytes in nasmlib/saa.c.
- CVE-2020-24242 (ADD, Seoul National University)
    >In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.15rc10, SEGV can be triggered in tok_text in asm/preproc.c by accessing READ memory.
- CVE-2020-24977 (ADD, Seoul National University)
    >GNOME project libxml2 v2.9.10 has a global buffer over-read vulnerability in xmlEncodeEntitiesInternal at libxml2/entities.c.
- CVE-2020-24978 (ADD, Seoul National University)
    >In NASM 2.15.04rc3, there is a double-free vulnerability in pp_tokline asm/preproc.c.

> 저는 대한민국 육군 대위로 7년간 복무하며 AI를 활용한 정보 보안 업무를 담당했습니다.  
> 처음 5년은 국방과학연구소(ADD)에서 보안 연구원으로 근무하며 사이버 보안 분야에 딥러닝을 적용하는 연구를 했습니다.
> 그 후 2년은 사이버작전사령부에서 근무하면서 작전적 측면에서 분석 업무를 수행하며 군 보안에 기여했습니다.  
> 고려대학교에서 [오성준](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=ebq6ex0AAAAJ) 교수님의 지도 아래 정보보안 석사 학위를 취득했습니다.
> 석사 논문은 데이터 샘플링을 통한 `Learning with noisy labels`에 관한 연구였습니다.

## CVE
- CVE-2020-24240 (ADD, Seoul National University)
    >GNU Bison before 3.7.1 has a use-after-free in _obstack_free in lib/obstack.c (called from gram_lex) when a '\0' byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself,not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.
- CVE-2020-24241 (ADD, Seoul National University)
    >In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.15rc10, there is heap use-after-free in saa_wbytes in nasmlib/saa.c.
- CVE-2020-24242 (ADD, Seoul National University)
    >In Netwide Assembler (NASM) 2.15rc10, SEGV can be triggered in tok_text in asm/preproc.c by accessing READ memory.
- CVE-2020-24977 (ADD, Seoul National University)
    >GNOME project libxml2 v2.9.10 has a global buffer over-read vulnerability in xmlEncodeEntitiesInternal at libxml2/entities.c.
- CVE-2020-24978 (ADD, Seoul National University)
    >In NASM 2.15.04rc3, there is a double-free vulnerability in pp_tokline asm/preproc.c.
